# Heartattack
Developed in the Introduction to Data Science course by: Kevin Reyes. 
## Objectives
- Predict the probability of suffering a heart attack using Bayesian Networks.
- Apply variable elimination method on a directed acyclic graph and compare the result with the methods implemented in pgmpy.

## Description
Bayesian Network Model applied to the prediction of a heart attack.

## Conclusions
- Since finding the optimal ordering of summations over the hidden variables is an NP-HARD problem, criteria or metaheuristics must be defined to achieve a result close to the optimal one.
- The probability of having a heart attack increases considerably when a patient is a smoker and has high cholesterol.
- The probability of having high blood pressure if you have had a heart attack is greater than 90%.

## Technology stack
